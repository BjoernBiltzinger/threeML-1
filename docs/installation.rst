Conda installation (suggested)
------------------------------

`Conda`_ is a platform independent package manager. It allows to install
3ML (and a lot of other software) without the need to compile anything,
and in a completely separate environment from your system and your
system python.

If you do not know Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not familiar with conda, install 3ML with the automatic
script which will take care of everything:

1. Download the script from `here`_
2. Run the script with ``bash install_3ML.sh``
3. The script will install 3ML and then create a ``threeML_init.sh``
   script and a ``threeML_init.csh`` script. Source the former if you
   are using Bash (``source threeML_init.sh``) and the second one if you
   are using Csh/Tcsh (``source threeML_init.csh``).

If you already know Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are familiar with Conda and you already have it installed, you
can install threeML by creating an environment with:

.. code:: bash

    conda create --name threeML -c conda-forge python=2.7 numpy scipy matplotlib

then activating your environment and installing 3ML as:

.. code:: bash

    source activate threeML
    conda install -c conda-forge -c threeml threeml

Other dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to set up packages such as AERIE (for HAWC), or the Fermi
Science Tools, before running the script, otherwise some of the
functionalities will not work.

-  AERIE for HAWC: make sure that this works before running the script:

   .. code:: bash

       > liff-PointSourceExpectation --version
       INFO [CommandLineConfigurator.cc, ParseCommandLine:137]: 

        liff-PointSourceExpectation
        Aerie version: 2.04.00
        Build type: Debug

   If it does not, you need to set up the HAWC environment (refer to the
   appropriate documentation)

-  Fermi Science Tools for Fermi/LAT analysis: make sure that this
   works:
   
   .. code:: bash
       
       > gtirfs   
       ...   
       P8R2_TRANSIENT100_V6::EDISP0   
       P8R2_TRANSIENT100_V6::EDISP1   
       ...
   
   If it does not, you need to configure and set up the Fermi Science
   Tools.

-  ROOT: ROOT is not required by 3ML, but it provides the Minuit2
   minimizer which can be used in 3ML. If you have ROOT, make sure that
   this works before running the script:
   
   .. code:: bash
       
       > root-config --version
       5.34/36
   
Install using pip (advanced)
----------------------------

Since this method alters the python environment you have on your system,
we suggest you use this method only if you understand the implications.

Remove any previous installation you might have with:

.. code:: bash

    > pip uninstall threeML
    > pip uninstall astromodels
    > pip uninstall cthreeML

then:

.. code:: bash

    > pip install numpy scipy ipython
    > pip install git+https://github.com/giacomov/3ML.git 
    > pip install git+https://github.com/giacomov/astromodels.git --upgrade

In order to use the HAWC plugin, you will also need to install cthreeML
(run this *after* setting up the HAWC environment):

.. code:: bash
    
    > pip install git+https://github.com/giacomov/
